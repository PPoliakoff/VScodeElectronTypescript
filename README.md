# VScodeElectronTypescript
This a boilerplate for an electron project witten in typescript and using VS code as an ditor / debugger

To use it you need to have already installed NPM and VS CODE

After cloning the project

* Install electron :
Open a PowerShell terminal in Visual Studio code (with Ctrl+\` keyboard shortcut on a QWERTY keyboard and Ctrl+ù on a AZERTY keyboard) 
In the PowerShell install electron:

D:\MyPrograms\electron\test> npm install electron

Note that I do not us the “-g” option that makes the installation global since it cause problems for vscode
 

*	In the same PowerShell install typescript:

D:\MyPrograms\electron\test> npm install typescript

To avoid error TS2307: Cannot find module 'electron'.I also here do not use the -g option
